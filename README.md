## 1. How can understanding your audience’s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?
It helps tailor the depth of explanations and terminology used, ensuring the content is neither too complex for novices nor too simplistic for experts.

Use plain language for non-technical audiences.
Include detailed explanations or references for experts.
Provide examples and visuals that match the audience's familiarity with the topic.

Conduct surveys, review feedback, analyze demographic data, or start with general concepts and adapt based on their responses.

## 4. What techniques can you use to ensure your content is accessible to those with limited technical knowledge?
Use simple language.
Break complex ideas into smaller steps.

## 5. Why is it important to use plain language instead of technical jargon in your writing?
Plain language ensures clarity, broadens accessibility, and reduces the risk of miscommunication or frustration among non-technical readers.
